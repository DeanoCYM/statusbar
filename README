This is a status bar for dwm. It works by setting the root window name
in X11 to a string constructed from system information. It is specific
to my set up (pulseaudio, battery etc.) but can be easily customised. 

Usage:

To compile and run debug build that will only print to stdout.

$ make
$ ./statusbar

To compile and run a build that will update the dwm status area

$ make build
$ ./statusbar

To compile, install to system and run.

$ sudo make install
$ /usr/local/bin/statusbar

A systemd service file is provided, it will wait for x11 to be open
then launches the program, automatically stopping it when x11
closes. 

$ cp statusbar.service xsession.target $HOME/.config/systemd/user

To set up an x11 target copy the following to your .xinitrc

# systemd hook (used to launch scripts instead of this file)
# unit files can be found in $HOME/.config/systemd/user/
systemctl --user import-environment PATH DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS DISPLAY
systemctl --no-block --user start xsession.target

Finally, install and enable autostart with:

systemctl --user start statusbar.service
systemctl --user enable statusbar.service
